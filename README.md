# Iptables Log Analyzer

A tool for the identificaction and detection of network attacks has been developed. The tool was developed in the python programming language and leverages iptables logs to provide further insights about what is happening on a network. The logs produced by the tool can assist the system administrator in the detection of malicious activities conducted by attackers and can be useful within incident handling operations.
